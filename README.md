# ðŸš— Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

## ðŸŒŽ Project Overview

This project is a simulation of a real-time **dynamic pricing engine** for 14 urban parking spaces across 73 days. Unlike static pricing which often leads to congestion or underuse, our system adapts in real-time to:

- Current occupancy levels
- Queue lengths
- Nearby traffic
- Vehicle types
- Special day indicators
- Competition from nearby lots

The result: smarter, fairer, and more efficient parking pricing.
